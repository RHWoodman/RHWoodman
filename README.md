- 👋 Hi, I’m @RHWoodman
- 👀 I’m an analytical chemist by experience but a biochemist by training, and I am interested in learning to code.
- 🌱 I am interested in VBA and R and in statistics-related programming projects as applied to quality control and quality assurance.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on projects so much as learn how to do things I need professionally at work. However, I am open to collaborating on projects with a chemistry angle.
