- 👋 Hi, I’m @RHWoodman
- 👀 I’m an analytical chemist by experience but a biochemist by training, and I am quite interested in learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VBA, especially for Excel, but I want to develop a broad knowledge across multiple languages. Of course, I have to do it in my "spare time." HaHaHa!
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on projects so much as learn how to do things I need professionally at work. However, I am open to collaborating on projects that have a chemistry angle to them.
